## Overview
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems.  
I think that this is very good educational tool to study way of thinking programming, and algorithm.  
It's more important logical thinking, of cource mathematical, therefore if you learned mathematical at junior high school, you can challenge nicely.   
   
If during a free moment, I will challenge a new problem, and add comment easy to understand.  
I use Haskell programming language.
